-- Prelude operations.
--
-- Note that we didn't derive Eq, Ord, Bounded or Show for "Day" and "Tree". We can 
-- do that now with operations from RepLib.PreludeLib.

-- for Day
instance Eq Day      where 
  (==) = eqR1 rep1
instance Ord Day     where 
  compare = compareR1 rep1
instance Bounded Day where 
  minBound = minBoundR1 rep1 
  maxBound = maxBoundR1 rep1
instance Show Day    where 
  showsPrec = showsPrecR1 rep1

-- for Tree
instance (Rep a, Eq a) => Eq (Tree a)     where (==) = eqR1 rep1
instance (Rep a, Show a) => Show (Tree a) where showsPrec = showsPrecR1 rep1
instance (Rep a, Ord a) => Ord (Tree a)   where compare = compareR1 rep1

-- Besides the prelude operations, RepLib provides a number of other 
-- type-indexed operations.

--
-- Instances for RepLib.Lib operations
--

-- Generate creates arbitrary elements of a type, up to a certain depth.
instance Generate Day
instance Generate a => Generate (Tree a)
instance Generate Company
instance Generate Dept
instance Generate Manager
instance Generate CUnit
instance Generate Employee
instance Generate Person
instance Generate Salary					  
	 

-- Sum adds together all of the Ints in a datastructure
instance GSum a => GSum (Tree a)
instance GSum Company
instance GSum Dept
instance GSum Manager
instance GSum CUnit
instance GSum Employee
instance GSum Person
instance GSum Salary

-- Shrink creates smaller versions of a data structure.
instance Shrink a => Shrink (Tree a)

-- 
-- SYB Style operations
-- 
-- RepLib also supports many of the combinators from the SYB library. For example, 
-- we can include the following code from the "Paradise" benchmark that gives everyone 
-- in the company a raise.

-- Increase salary by percentage
increase :: Float -> Company -> Company
increase k = everywhere (mkT (incS k))

-- "interesting" code for increase
incS :: Float -> Salary -> Salary
incS k (S s) = S (s * (1+k))


--
-- Generalized folds
--
-- finally, we define generalized versions of fold left and 
-- fold right for the Tree type constructor.
