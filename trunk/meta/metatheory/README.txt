COMPILATION, INSTALLATION, AND DOCUMENTATION:

  The main documentation for this library, including installation
  instructions and Coq documentation, is available as a collection of
  HTML files.  Start by opening doc/index.html in a web browser.

TUTORIAL:

  The metatheory library comes with a short tutorial.  The main files for
  the tutorial are CoqIntro.v, STLC.v, and STLCsol.v.  Make sure that you've
  compiled the library first.

  Those new to Coq should start with CoqIntro.v, which is an introduction to
  using Coq.  Solutions to the exercises here are at the end of the file.

  After CoqIntro.v, the next part of the tutorial is STLC.v, an introduction
  to mechanizing programming language definitions with binding in Coq and
  how to reason about them.  Solutions to exercises here are in STLCsol.v.
