Unbound is a domain-specific language and library for working with
binding structure.  Implemented on top of the RepLib generic
programming framework, it automatically provides operations such as
alpha equivalence, capture-avoiding substitution, and free variable
calculation for user-defined data types (including GADTs), requiring
only a tiny bit of boilerplate on the part of the user.  It features a
simple yet rich combinator language for binding specifications,
including support for pattern binding, type annotations, recursive
binding, nested binding, set-like (unordered) binders, and multiple
atom types.
